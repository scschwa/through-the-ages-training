  "_comment": "Balanced mid-Age II state. You have 5 civil actions, good production, reasonable military. Card row has Code of Laws (6th CA) and Shakespeare (strong culture leader). Interesting tension: 6th CA vs Shakespeare vs Tactics. Test: the coach should weigh the 6th CA against closing the small military gap.",
