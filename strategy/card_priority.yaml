card_draft_priority:

  framework:
    description: >
      When multiple cards are available and you can only take one, use this
      hierarchy. Context always overrides tiers — a Tier 2 card that directly
      solves a critical gap beats a Tier 1 card you don't need.
    key_principle: >
      Every card costs a civil action to draft (and usually more to build).
      The question is always: "What is the highest expected value use of
      this civil action given my current gaps?"

  tier_1:
    label: "Always Consider First"
    description: >
      If these are available AND you are deficient in the corresponding area,
      these beat almost everything else.

    civil_actions:
      examples: ["Code of Laws", "Aristocracy", "Philosophy", "Printing Press"]
      condition: "You have fewer than 6 Civil Actions"
      rationale: >
        Civil actions are the engine behind every other action. Each CA
        you add is worth roughly 1 full extra action per round for the
        rest of the game. This compounds enormously.
      priority: "Highest possible priority if you are below 6 CA"
      special_note: >
        Code of Laws gives 2 CAs for one draft slot. It is the most
        efficient CA-acquisition card in the game.

    military_actions:
      examples: ["Warfare", "Military Action cards"]
      condition: "You have fewer than 3 Military Actions"
      rationale: >
        Three Military Actions is the minimum for competitive card cycling.
        Below 3, you are constrained in your military response options.

    science_buildings:
      examples: ["Library", "Alchemy", "Observatory", "any science building"]
      condition: "You produce fewer than 3 science per turn"
      rationale: >
        Science cannot be overproduced. Missing science production in Age I
        means missing technology upgrades in Age II — a permanent setback.
      priority: "Competes with CA for top priority; both are foundational"

  tier_2:
    label: "Strong Situational Pickups"
    description: "Take these when Tier 1 needs are met or when the Tier 1 options are unavailable."

    military_units:
      examples: ["Swordsmen", "Knights", "Chivalry", "Air Force"]
      condition: "You are at or below your military threshold (within 2 of opponents)"
      best: >
        Knights and Swordsmen are optimal for Ages I-II — best punch
        per ore and per civil action. Do not upgrade past Age-appropriate units
        just because an Age III unit is visible.

    tactics_cards:
      examples: ["Any Tactics card"]
      rationale: >
        A single Tactics card can increase effective military strength by
        30-50% without spending ore on new units. This is frequently the
        highest-efficiency military investment available.
      note: >
        Often better than buying a new unit when you already have some
        military base to multiply.

    culture_engines:
      examples: ["Drama", "Shakespeare's plays", "Renaissance", "Colosseum"]
      condition: "Your culture production is below 5 per turn by mid-Age II"
      rationale: "Culture production compounds; every point per turn matters at game end"

    wonder_enablers:
      description: "Cards that synergize with your active wonder construction"
      condition: "You have a wonder in progress and the card accelerates completion"

  tier_3:
    label: "Good but Situational"

    economic_upgrades:
      examples: ["Iron Age Farms", "Iron Age Mines", "advanced food/ore buildings"]
      note: "Good early; diminishing returns in Age III when time horizon is short"
      condition: >
        Take if you are worker-bottlenecked (food production limiting
        worker count limiting production rate).

    colonies:
      rationale: "Strong if you have Military Actions to spare and colony reward is favorable"
      condition: "Only worthwhile with 3+ Military Actions and no active military crisis"

    leader_upgrades:
      note: >
        Depends heavily on current leader synergies and what abilities
        the new leader provides.

  tier_4:
    label: "Denial Picks"
    description: >
      Take a card an opponent needs even if it is suboptimal for you.
      Only valid when you are in a position to absorb a suboptimal pick.

    conditions:
      - "You are in a strong position and can afford a suboptimal civil action"
      - "The card would directly power a threatening opponent's strategy"

    priority_denial_targets:
      - "Powerful military cards when an aggressive opponent is currently weak in military"
      - "Strong culture cards when a culture-leading opponent is pulling away"
      - "Civil Action cards when you are already at 6 CA — deny it rather than let opponents get 6 CA"
      - "Key Tactics cards when an opponent has built up many units"

  draft_order_awareness:
    late_draft_position:
      description: "Going last in draft means fewer options but better reactive picks"
      strategy: >
        Prioritize denial and reactive picks. Take what opponents left rather
        than chasing a pre-planned build order.

    early_draft_position:
      description: "Going first means best card, but opponents react to your picks"
      strategy: >
        Be unpredictable. Do not always signal your strategy with predictable
        first picks. Mixing in denial or off-strategy picks occasionally keeps
        opponents guessing.

  four_player_card_economy:
    description: >
      In 4-player games, the card row depletes faster than in 2-player games.
      Valuable cards frequently disappear in one round.
    implication: >
      Do not assume a strong card will still be available next round.
      If you can take it now and afford the civil action cost, do so.
    exception: >
      Age I cards become obsolete quickly in Age II. Do not over-invest
      in Age I cards late in Age I when Age II cards are about to arrive.
