leaders_overview:
  note: >
    New Leaders & Wonders expansion adds 24 new leaders (6 per age).
    Leader choice is one of the most impactful decisions in each age.
  general_principle: >
    Pick the leader that amplifies your current strategic path, not the
    most famous name. The strongest leader is the one whose ability
    synergizes with what you are already doing.
  upgrade_cost: "Upgrading to a new leader costs 1 civil action"
  upgrade_timing: >
    Time upgrades so that the leader's benefit starts to matter immediately
    after you take them. Taking Napoleon at the start of Age III when you
    plan a mid-Age III military push is optimal; taking him with 2 rounds left
    is wasteful.
  signaling_risk: >
    Some leaders signal your intent clearly to opponents, giving them time
    to counter. Factor this into your pick.

age_i_leaders:
  moses:
    strength: "Colonization and early religious culture generation"
    best_pairing: "Early expansion, colony-focused build with military actions to exploit"
    threat_level: low
    notes: "Does not signal military intent; safe pick in escalation-heavy games"

  hammurabi:
    strength: "Law-based civil efficiency improvements"
    best_pairing: "Civil action acceleration builds in Age I"
    threat_level: low
    notes: "Good for CA-focused openers"

  ramesses:
    strength: "Wonder construction acceleration"
    best_pairing: "Age I wonder rush when you have strong production"
    threat_level: low

age_ii_leaders:
  caesar:
    strength: "Military and production efficiency hybrid"
    best_pairing: "Mixed military-economy build; flexible"
    threat_level: medium
    notes: >
      Strong fallback if top military leaders are unavailable.
      Signals moderate military intent without committing you to full aggression.

  alexander:
    strength: "Military expansion and colonization"
    best_pairing: "Aggressive early Age II military build"
    threat_level: high
    notes: >
      Signals aggressive intent to all opponents. In your 4-player
      escalation-heavy group, picking Alexander may cause all three
      opponents to escalate preemptively against you.
    warning: "High signaling risk in groups that respond to military signals"

  constantine:
    strength: "Religious culture production"
    best_pairing: "Culture engine build in Age II"
    threat_level: low
    notes: >
      Low military threat; makes you a culture target. Only viable if
      you establish military credibility independently or opponents are
      fighting each other.

age_iii_leaders:
  napoleon:
    strength: "Late-game military dominance — best military multiplier in the game"
    best_pairing: "Age III military push with Air Force + War for Culture"
    threat_level: very_high
    signaling: "Signals decisive late aggression to everyone at the table"
    tactical_use: >
      Take only if you are planning a concrete Age III military action.
      If opponents see you take Napoleon and they can preemptively
      outbuild you in Air Force, you have wasted the pick.
    condition_for_success: >
      You have more science production than opponents (enabling faster
      Air Force upgrade) OR you take Napoleon exactly when you are
      ready to execute the military action, not turns beforehand.

  genghis_khan:
    strength: "Early-mid aggressive raiding with cavalry; strong with Tactics"
    best_pairing: "Tactics + Knights combo in Ages I-II"
    threat_level: very_high
    signaling: "Immediately signals aggressor role to all opponents"
    tactical_use: >
      Strong if you plan to be the initiating aggressor in the arms race.
      Extremely risky in 4-player where all three opponents will
      counter-build. In your specific group's escalation dynamic,
      this leader likely triggers the exact arms race you want to avoid.
    warning: "In 4-player escalation groups: high risk of triggering group response"

  shakespeare:
    strength: "Exceptional culture rate — best cultural multiplier in the game"
    best_pairing: "Dedicated culture engine with pre-established military deterrence"
    threat_level: near_zero
    signaling: "Makes you THE culture target at the table"
    tactical_use: >
      Extremely powerful but requires specific conditions to work:
      1. You have already established military credibility (opponents are
         occupied fighting each other), OR
      2. You accept that you will be a raid target and have built enough
         military to absorb one attack, OR
      3. You are far enough ahead in culture that opponents cannot catch
         up even with successful raids against you.
    warning: >
      In your specific 4-player escalation group: risky unless
      opponents are demonstrably busy attacking each other and not you.
      Consider whether picking Shakespeare will unify your opponents
      against you.

  darwin:
    strength: "Science and technology acceleration"
    best_pairing: "Science rush → Age III technology dominance including military"
    threat_level: low_direct
    notes: >
      Low direct military threat but enables future military power via
      technology advantage. Strong in games where you want to match
      militarists in Age III without having escalated earlier.

  columbus:
    strength: "Colonial expansion engine"
    best_pairing: "Extra Military Actions into colony exploitation"
    threat_level: medium
    notes: "Requires Military Actions but not direct combat; moderate threat signal"

  newton:
    strength: "Strongest science leader in the game"
    best_pairing: "Science-heavy builds → technology advantage"
    threat_level: low
    notes: >
      Low direct threat. Long-term enables military via science,
      but opponents rarely perceive this as threatening until Age III.

leadership_meta_notes:
  adaptive_leader_choice: >
    Choosing a leader is itself an adaptive decision. Assess what your
    current strategy needs most, what signals are safe to send to opponents,
    and what the leader's ability will be worth given the number of rounds
    remaining in the age.
  upgrade_vs_hold: >
    Sometimes holding your current leader for one more round (to get more
    value from their ability before upgrading) is better than immediately
    taking the next age's best leader. Time the upgrade for maximum overlap.
