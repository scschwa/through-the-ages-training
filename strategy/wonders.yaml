wonders_overview:
  description: >
    Wonders are constructed over multiple turns. Each stage costs production
    resources (ore). Points and special abilities activate only on completion.
    An incomplete wonder at game end returns nothing.

  construction_rule: >
    Before starting any wonder, calculate whether you can complete it
    given remaining rounds and your ore production rate.
    Formula: stages_remaining × ore_per_stage ≤ remaining_rounds × ore_production

  games_per_wonder:
    age_i: "1 Age I wonder is common; more is possible with fast starts and strong production"
    age_ii: "1-2 Age II wonders is standard for a well-functioning game"
    age_iii: "1 Age III wonder per game per player — 2 requires exceptional production economy"

wonder_strategy:
  commitment_rule:
    description: "Never start a wonder you cannot complete before Age changes or game end."
    cost_of_failure: >
      You spend civil actions drafting and initiating, production resources
      on partial stages, and receive zero points and zero ability activation.
    check: "Count remaining rounds × ore production rate vs. total ore cost remaining"

  age_iii_warning:
    description: "Do not start an Age III wonder in the last 2-3 rounds of the age."
    typical_timing: "Start Age III wonder in early Age III; aim to complete mid-to-late Age III"
    if_behind_on_points: >
      A completed Age III wonder can recover 15-25+ points. If you are
      behind on culture points entering Age III, completing an Age III
      wonder should be a top priority — but only if you can actually finish it.

  abort_condition: >
    If you are 2+ stages from completion with 2 rounds left in an age
    and cannot possibly complete it, redirect ore production elsewhere.
    Sunk cost is sunk — do not compound the mistake.

  wonder_vs_building:
    comparison: >
      Wonders typically provide points + unique special abilities.
      Buildings provide ongoing production bonuses.
    when_to_prefer_wonder: >
      When the wonder's ability directly synergizes with your current
      strategy AND you can complete it efficiently.
    when_to_prefer_building: >
      When your production is too low to complete the wonder cleanly,
      or when the building provides an ongoing bonus that compounds
      more than the wonder's point injection.

notable_wonders:
  age_i:
    pyramids:
      effect: "Draw yellow (civil) cards for free — reduces civil action cost of drafting"
      strategic_value: >
        Strong for civil action conservation and card draw acceleration.
        Pairs well with CA-hungry early builds.
      when_to_build: "Early Age I if you can complete it before Age I ends"

    colosseum_age_i:
      note: "Age I small wonders vary by edition; check your card for specific effects"

  age_ii:
    hanging_gardens:
      effect: "Bonus food production — accelerates your worker engine"
      strategic_value: "Amplifies production economy; frees food for more workers"
      pairing: "Best with production-heavy builds that need more workers"

    st_peters_cathedral:
      effect: "Bonus culture and happiness"
      strategic_value: "Solid culture production boost"

    general_age_ii:
      note: >
        Age II wonders are the sweet spot — completion is realistic with a
        working economy, and their abilities activate early enough to matter.
        Prioritize Age II wonders over immediately rushing an Age III wonder.

  age_iii:
    general:
      strategic_consideration: >
        The key question for any Age III wonder: does this wonder's ability
        benefit my current strategy, or am I building it only for points?
        Building purely for points is valid in Age III if production is
        strong and completion is guaranteed.
      timing_critical: >
        Age III wonders are expensive. Starting too late means failing to
        complete — which is catastrophically wasteful. Plan the Age III
        wonder from mid-Age II.

  expansion_wonders:
    silk_road:
      source: "New Leaders & Wonders expansion"
      effect: "Economic trade and resource generation flexibility"
      strategic_value: "Strong for production-heavy builds needing resource flexibility"
      when_optimal: "When ore or food is a bottleneck and you have the civil actions to exploit trade routes"

    red_cross:
      source: "New Leaders & Wonders expansion"
      effect: "Military recovery and defensive ability"
      strategic_value: "Useful in heavy-military games for absorbing raid consequences"
      when_optimal: "When you have taken a military hit or anticipate incoming aggression"

    colosseum:
      source: "Base game / expansion variant"
      effect: "Culture points and happiness bonus"
      strategic_value: "Reliable culture engine wonder; good in culture-focused strategies"

wonder_timing_heuristic:
  formula: "stages_remaining × ore_per_stage ≤ remaining_rounds × ore_production_per_round"
  rule_of_thumb: >
    If you cannot complete the wonder in the current age, either start it
    very early in the next age, or do not start it at all.
  example: >
    Age III wonder costs 4 ore per stage with 3 stages remaining.
    You produce 5 ore/round. You need 12 ore / 5 per round = 2.4 rounds minimum.
    If 3+ rounds remain in Age III: safe to start.
    If 2 rounds remain: too risky — do not start.

competitive_wonder_notes:
  signaling: >
    Building a powerful culture wonder (Shakespeare's theater, etc.) signals
    your culture focus to opponents and may draw military attention.
    Have a military response plan ready before completing such a wonder.
  wonder_race: >
    In 4-player games, multiple players often want the same limited-supply
    wonders. Track which wonders opponents are building and plan alternatives
    to avoid competing for a wonder that will be finished by another player first.
