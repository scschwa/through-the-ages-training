military_strategy:

  core_principle:
    rule: "The 'Hair's Breadth' Rule"
    description: >
      You do not need to lead in military. You do not even need to be second.
      What you need is to be close enough that attacking you costs the attacker
      more than the attack is worth.
    target_differential:
      max_acceptable_gap: 2
      unit: "military strength points behind nearest likely aggressor"
      rationale: >
        A gap greater than 2 makes you an attractive raid target.
        A gap of 0-2 means aggression costs the attacker a civil action plus
        a war card burn with uncertain reward — most rational opponents will
        look for easier targets.

  escalation_drain:
    description: >
      When three or more players simultaneously escalate military against each
      other, each one drains civil actions into military that should go to
      food → workers → production → science → culture.
    implication: >
      The player who understands the minimum viable military threshold wins by
      out-producing escalating opponents. Every civil action your opponent
      spends on a military unit beyond what's needed is a civil action not
      spent on the things that win games.
    your_goal: >
      Be the one player NOT in the escalation loop. Let opponents police each
      other's military while you accumulate culture production advantage.

  four_player_specific:
    group_dynamics: >
      In 4-player games, three opponents collectively police each other's
      military. You benefit from this dynamic — they are watching each other
      more than they are watching you, provided you are not visibly weak.
    coordination_trap: >
      If all three opponents escalate, they each weaken their own economy.
      This is their mistake, not yours. Do not join the escalation; profit from it.
    targeting_logic: >
      You become a target when you look 'safe': low military, high visible
      culture score. Counter this by keeping military credible (within
      hair's breadth), not by leading it.

  posture_types:
    raid:
      when_to_use: >
        You have a clear military lead AND an opponent has culture production
        significantly higher than yours, making the game a culture race you
        are losing.
      rationale: >
        A War for Culture creates roughly a 60-point swing. This is worth
        the civil action cost ONLY when it changes the game outcome.
      risk: "Escalates the arms race; signals you as an aggressor; use sparingly"
      rule_of_thumb: "Raid to change losing trajectories, not to stay ahead"

    threaten:
      when_to_use: >
        You are within 2 of opponents but not leading. You want to deter
        attacks without spending additional civil actions on military.
      how: >
        Draft a Warfare or Tactics card visibly. Build one unit as a signal.
        The threat of retaliation is often sufficient.
      rationale: "Credible threat without actual aggression preserves civil actions for economy"

    ignore:
      when_to_use: >
        Military competition is fierce and balanced among three or more players;
        you are not the weakest player militarily.
      rationale: >
        Let others exhaust civil actions on military while you build economy
        and culture production.
      risk: >
        Must maintain enough military that ignoring further escalation does NOT
        make you the easiest target. You can only ignore if you are within
        hair's breadth.

  counter_escalation:
    when_you_are_targeted:
      - "Buy one military card immediately — not to win the arms race, but to raise cost of attacking you"
      - "Draft the best available Tactics card (multiplies existing units; often better than more units)"
      - "Signal retaliatory intent: opponents must believe attacking you will cost them"

    age_iii_inflection:
      description: >
        By late Age II / early Age III, Air Force replaces earlier units as the
        dominant force multiplier. The player who upgrades first gains decisive
        military advantage.
      key_insight: >
        Science and economy are the TRUE foundations of Age III military power —
        not early unit purchases. A player who invested in science in Ages I-II
        can match mid-game militarists in Age III without having escalated earlier.
      implication: >
        Building science early is also building future military capability.
        This is a key argument against joining the escalation loop in Age I-II.

  unit_efficiency:
    age_i_ii:
      best_units: ["Swordsmen", "Knights"]
      rationale: >
        Knights and Swordsmen are the most cost-efficient military units for
        Ages I through II — best punch per resource and per civil action.

    age_iii:
      best_units: ["Air Force"]
      rationale: >
        Air Force is the decisive endgame unit. Building it requires
        science investment from earlier ages.

    tactics_cards:
      value: >
        A single Tactics card can increase effective military power by 30-50%
        without spending ore on new units. Tactics cards are often the
        highest-efficiency military investment available.

  war_for_culture:
    description: "Military aggression combined with War for Culture creates a ~60-point swing"
    calculation: >
      You gain culture points equal to your military lead; opponent loses the
      same. Net swing is roughly double your military advantage.
    when_optimal: >
      Only optimal when you are BOTH: (1) winning the military race AND
      (2) losing the culture production race. Using it otherwise wastes the
      civil action and the war card.
